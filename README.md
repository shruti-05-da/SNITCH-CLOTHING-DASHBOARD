# snitch_data_dashboard
i cleaned the data of snitch clothing brand and did data analysis on it

Using a blend of Excel, Python, and Power BI, I transformed raw sales records from Snitch Clothing into a set of actionable retail insights. The data, which spanned product details, customer profiles, order histories, and sales channels, was initially messy — with inconsistent category names, missing size data, and irregular date formats.

In Excel, I handled the initial cleanup and standardization. Python came next, enabling advanced trend detection and segmentation — such as isolating high-value repeat customers, mapping seasonal demand for specific categories, and uncovering the most profitable sales channels. Power BI then turned these findings into an interactive dashboard where managers could explore product performance by month, customer type, or channel, all in real time.

The analysis revealed that a small group of SKUs drove a majority of revenue, repeat customers generated significantly higher lifetime value, and demand for certain sizes outpaced production during peak seasons. These insights were used to adjust inventory purchasing, refocus marketing spend toward top-performing customer segments, and schedule promotions around predictable demand surges.

This project showcased how cleaning and connecting multiple data sources can directly influence operational and marketing strategies in retail — turning spreadsheets into strategic advantage.

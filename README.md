# SNITCH CLOTHING DASHBOARD 
This project is an end-to-end retail data analysis workflow that transformed raw sales records from Snitch Clothing into actionable business insights. The dataset included product details, customer profiles, order histories, and sales channels — but was initially messy with inconsistent category names, missing size information, and irregular date formats.

Using a combination of Excel, Python, and Power BI, the data was cleaned, analyzed, and visualized to uncover key trends in customer behavior, product performance, and sales channels. The insights generated were used to refine marketing strategies, optimize inventory, and plan promotions around peak demand periods.
